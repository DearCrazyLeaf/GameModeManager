# GameModeManager
A Counter-Strike 2 server plugin to help administrators manage custom game modes, settings, and map rotations. 

Inspired by [CS2 Modded Dedicated Server by Kus](https://github.com/kus/cs2-modded-server) and the [CS2 Rock The Vote plugin by Abnerfs](https://github.com/abnerfs/cs2-rockthevote).

## Description
Tired of manually managing game modes, settings, and maps?

GameModeManager simplifies server administration for Counter-Strike 2 by providing:

- **Admin menus** for modes, maps, and settings.
- **Customizable rotation** of maps and game modes.
- **Player voting** for maps, settings, and game modes.
- **Shared API** for cross-plugin development and integration.
- **Built-in RTV** that can be customized to include modes and maps.
- **Dynamic map lists and menus** based on the current game mode or all game modes.
- **Customization options** for rotation schedules, commands, voting styles, and languages.

This plugin is perfect for servers with a variety of custom content or those that want to give players more control over their experience.
