# GameModeManager
A Counter-Strike 2 server plugin inspired by the [CS2 Modded Dedicated Server by Kus](https://github.com/kus/cs2-modded-server) and the [CS2 Rock The Vote plugin by Abnerfs](https://github.com/abnerfs/cs2-rockthevote). This plugin simplifies game mode management and enhances your server's experience.

## Description

- **Dynamic Map Lists:** Automatically updates your maplist.txt file based on the current game mode or map group, eliminating manual map changes.

- **Customizable Game Modes:** Easily define your server's game mode list and switch between them effortlessly using admin commands.

## Requirements
- Counter-Strike 2
- Metamod:Source v1282+
- Counter Strike Sharp v.197+

## Commands
- `css_mapgroup` - Sets the map group and updates the map list.

## Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> On first load, a configuration file will be created in `csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/GameModeManager/GameModeManager.json`.

1. Install Metamod:Source and Counter Strike Sharp.
2. Copy DLLs to `csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins/GameModeManager`.
3. Ensure your `gamemodes_server.txt` file contains a list of map groups.
4. Update your custom configuration files for each game mode to include `css_mapgroup <map group>`.

## Configuration
GameModeManager offers flexible configuration options. See the default `GameModeManager.json` for details and customization instructions.

| Config              | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MapGroup            | Sets the default map group on server start.                                                                                               | 
| MapGroupsFile       | Default path for the gamemodes_server.txt file used to specify game modes and map groups.                                                 | 
| MapListFile         | Default path for the maplist.txt file that needs to be updated when the map group or game mode changes.                                   | 
| DefaultMapFormat    | Sets the format for adding maps to the maplist.txt file to the default value `ws:{workshopid}`.                                           |
| RTVEnabled          | If set to enabled, the RTV plugin specified will be reloaded after updating the maplist.txt file.                                         | 
| RTVPlugin           | This is the default path to the RTV Plugin you are using. This can also just be the Module Name.                                          | 
| ListEnabled         | When enabled, the Game Mode list specified will be used. Otherwise, the Game Mode list will be generated based on map groups discovered.  |
| GameModeList        | Allows you to specify the list of game modes for your server. The corresponding CFG files need to be located in the `csgo/cfg` directory. |                                          

> [!NOTE]
> - All game mode configuration files must be located in the `csgo/cfg` directory.
> - All game mode configuration files must include `css_mapgroup` to set the current map group.
> - By default, the plugin will create the map list using the format `{mapname}:{workshopid}` unless `DefaultMapFormat` is set to `true`.
> - If `ListEnabled` is set to `false`, the Game Mode List will be created based on the discovered map groups. For example, `mg_surf` would display as `surf` and the `surf.cfg` would be executed.
