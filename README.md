# GameModeManager
A Counter-Strike 2 server plugin to help administrators manage custom game modes, settings, and map rotations. 

Inspired by [CS2 Modded Dedicated Server by Kus](https://github.com/kus/cs2-modded-server) and the [CS2 Rock The Vote plugin by Abnerfs](https://github.com/abnerfs/cs2-rockthevote).

## Description
Tired of manually managing game modes, settings, and maps?

GameModeManager simplifies server administration for Counter-Strike 2 by providing:

- **Admin menus** for modes, maps, and settings.
- **Customizable rotation** of maps and game modes.
- **Player voting** for maps, settings, and game modes.
- **Shared API** for cross-plugin development and integration.
- **Built-in RTV** that can be customized to include modes and maps.
- **Dynamic map lists and menus** based on the current game mode or all game modes.
- **Customization options** for rotation schedules, commands, voting styles, and languages.

This plugin is perfect for servers with a variety of custom content or those that want to give players more control over their experience.

This plugin utilizes the [GameLoop.Vdf library](https://github.com/shravan2x/Gameloop.Vdf/) (licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/shravan2x/Gameloop.Vdf/blob/master/LICENSE)) for parsing the `gamemodes_server.txt` file, which is in [Valve Data Format](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VDF).

For creating custom votes, this plugin utilizes the [CS2-CustomVotes](https://github.com/imi-tat0r/CS2-CustomVotes) shared plugin API (licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/imi-tat0r/CS2-CustomVotes?tab=MIT-1-ov-file)).

Lastly, a special thanks to the [CS2 Rock The Vote plugin by Abnerfs](https://github.com/abnerfs/cs2-rockthevote). The plugin's use of the dependency injection framework served as the core architecture for the development of this plugin.

# Getting Started
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If this is your first time setting up a modded server, I highly suggest checking out the [CS2-Modded-Server Repo by Kus](https://github.com/kus/cs2-modded-server). It's a great resource for understanding how to set up custom game modes, which aren't included with this plugin. Additionally, it includes a preconfigured version of this plugin for beginners.

To get started, make sure all of the following prerequisites are met:

- All of your mode config files are located in `/csgo/cfg/`.
- Both [Metamode:Source](https://github.com/alliedmodders/metamod-source/) and [CounterStrikeSharp](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp) are installed.
- Your `gamemodes_server.txt` or custom map group file is in [VDF Format](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VDF) and contains a list of map groups.

## Installation
1. Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/nickj609/GameModeManager/releases/latest). 
2. Copy the `addons` and `cfg` folders to `/csgo/`.
3. Update each game mode configuration file (i.e. comp.cfg) to include `css_gamemode <mode>`.
4. After the first run, update the configuration file `GameModeManager.json`.

For more information about the configuration of this plugin and the use of the [Shared API](https://github.com/nickj609/GameModeManager/wiki/Shared-API), see our [Wiki](https://github.com/nickj609/GameModeManager/wiki).
